Over the course of eight months, through all the ups and downs, we succeeded! I am so proud of what we have managed to get done, and how much we were able to learn from one-another :) We plan to release our game April 16th on Steam!As to my role in this project, I was responsible not just for the implementation of many key gameplay mechanics, but also creating and stress-testing each build.","dxasm#dxasm":"A (work-in-progress) complete DX12 context and rendering setup built in pure x64 assembly! After a few years of coding in the higher-level, I felt very nostalgic of the brutal bare-metal lifestyle. I learned a lot about the stack and calling conventions during this project, and I plan to pursue it further into a 3D game.","oxygen#oxygen":"My submission for Ubisoft NEXT 2025. With an incredibly limitted (2D) API, I built a full 3D networked-multiplayer game, utilising binary-space-partition trees and multi-threaded software rasterization. This was one of the most intense projects I have ever worked on, I'm sure I dropped over a thousand hours into it. I am very proud of this project. (and I later ported it to the PSP for the kick of it)","develop-at-ubisoft-toronto-2024#Develop at Ubisoft Toronto 2024":"Looking back retrospectively upon this project. I don't feel it's my best. It was incredibly rushed and lacked the typical level of commitment I pride myself upon. However I guess it was enough to impress the judges at Ubisoft, landing me second place. It was absolutely thrilling to see the studio where some of the most talented people in the industry work, and I cannot recommend trying your hand their competitions more!"}},"/tags/[tag]":{"title":"Tagged Posts","data":{}}}
